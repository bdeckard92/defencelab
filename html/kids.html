        <p>It is an educational program which develops the children using martial arts as the vehicle, specifically self defence. The aim of this program is to teach children the abilities, attitudes and aptitudes that they need to develop in our current society which is in constant evolution.

Boys and girls will learn to respect their peers, learn good manners, be responsible and careful with the class material and their own items, to use their towel, etc. </p>

        <p>More importantly children will find it is a program that will help them in their personal growth and development. It will give them confidence and will make them believe in themselves, it will teach them that they can be all that they want to be, that we make our own limits.

A very important and revolutionary point in the DL Kids program is the interaction of parents with their children, which, through a qualified instructor will be guided to assume different roles; sometimes as teachers and sometimes as pupils. We provide parents with story books to read to the children that co-incide with the themes they are learning in the Martial Arts classes.

With all that, parents will understand what their children like, what things they enjoy the most, and see the importance of listening to their children, especially when they have something to say, show or teach.

It is a unique opportunity to understand this important part in the relationship. In addition, parents will understand a little better how their children are progressing and how they can help them to prepare for their exams and improve.

Here they have the opportunity to be near and learn to be together, both parts (fathers, mothers, sons and daughters), through the exchange of roles, because in the society we live in it seems that parents are always talking , and children must listen and learn, but adults also have much to learn from their children.</p>
